Included are multiple Arduino files that have been loaded onto an Arduino Uno
into a Nintendo Gamecube controller to implement macros, a string of button
commands executed through the press of one button. The Arduino has been
soldered to the controllers motherboard. A wire (yellow) has been attached from
the Arduino's 3.3V port into the controller's power supply. A (black) wire has
been inserted from the Arduino GND port to the controller's ground line. A wire
(red)  has been connected to the Arduino's D3 port and will acts as the input
for all controls. A wire (white) from the Arduino's D2 port was connected to
the motherboard as an output into the console.
